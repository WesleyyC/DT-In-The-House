Sad!The Republican Party needs strong and committed leaders, not weak people such as @JeffFlake, if it is going to stop illegal immigration.Crooked Hillary's V.P. pick said this morning that I was not aware that Russia took over Crimea. A total lie - and taken over during O term!Wow, the failing @nytimes has not reported properly on Crooked's FBI release. They are at the back of the pack - no longer a credible source.@CNN is so disgusting in their bias, but they are having a hard time promoting Crooked Hillary in light of the new e-mail scandals.Great visit to Detroit church, fantastic reception, and all @CNN talks about is a small protest outside.

Certain Republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U.S.Supreme Court get proper appointments. Sad!Stay on message is the chant. I always do - trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd A, repeal Ocare, borders, etc - but media misrepresents!I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!It is not freedom of the press when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it!Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose!My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20%The failing @nytimes, which never spoke to me, keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False, I am who I am-never saidThe failing @nytimes talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened. Their reporting is fiction. The media protects Hillary!We now have confirmation as to one reason Crooked H wanted to be sure that nobody saw her e-mails - PAY-FOR-PLAY. How can she run for Pres.I am truly enjoying myself while running for president. The people of our country are amazing - great numbers on November 8th!The failing @nytimes has become a newspaper of fiction. Their stories about me always quote non-existent unnamed sources. Very dishonest!Will be on @seanhannity tonight at 10pm, hosted by @GovMikeHuckabee. Enjoy!Thank you Erie, Pennsylvania!

When will the dishonest media report the facts!I love watching these poor, pathetic people (pundits) on television working so hard and so seriously to try and figure me out. They can't!A massive tax increase will be necessary to fund Crooked Hillary Clinton's agenda. What a terrible (and boring) rollout that was yesterday!Ratings challenged @CNN reports so seriously that I call President Obama (and Clinton) the founder of ISIS, & MVP. THEY DON'T GET SARCASM?Will be doing @oreillyfactor tonight at 8pm. Enjoy!This is no surprise. Constant phony reporting from failing @CNN turns everyone off.

That's what I said!When I said in an interview that Putin is not going into Ukraine, you can mark it down, I am saying if I am President. Already in Crimea!This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart!Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice!Wow, it is unbelievable how distorted, one-sided and biased the media is against us. The failing @nytimes is a joke. @CNN is laughable!The dishonest media is fawning over the Democratic Convention. I wonder why, then, my speech had millions of more viewers than Crooked H?I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me!Captain Khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our leaders to eradicate it!Nielson Media Research final numbers on ACCEPTANCE SPEECH: TRUMP  32.2 MILLION.

She is owned by Wall Street!Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.Hillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.Departing now - thank you Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

Highly overrated!You have no idea what my strategy on ISIS is, and neither does ISIS (a good thing). Please get your facts straight - thanks. @megynkellyFor the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia.In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster, the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump.

The Republican Convention was greatFunny, if you listen to @FoxNews, the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two, they are fawning. What a differenceBernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time.Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated!Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself.I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing.  He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air!Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke!While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.Clinton betrayed Bernie voters.

Great POLL numbers are coming out all over. People don't want another four years of Obama, and Crooked Hillary would be even worse. #MAGAThe State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE!Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance!Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her servant was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all! They laughed at Bernie.If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same.Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgainpic.twitter.com/Pzs9uwgzamHillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie!The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes meWatched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS & all others laughing!The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you!The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out!The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well!Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed outIf the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wildThe @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left!Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.)Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!There is no longer a Bernie Sanders political revolution. He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECTThe Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain
#TrumpPence16pic.twitter.com/gCzHX1nyxDThank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night. From the heart!The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud!Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me!I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGEDPocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her!Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight?I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam.Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did?Another attack, this time in Germany. Many killed. God bless the people of Munich.One of the best produced, including the incredible stage & set, in the history of conventions. Great unity! Big T.V. ratings! @KarlRoveThank you Cleveland. We love you and will be back many times!What a great four days in Cleveland. So proud of the great job done by the RNC and all.

The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melania's speech than the FBI spent on Hillary's emails.Good news is Melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press!In November, I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state. Jobs!Bill Hemmer of @FoxNews was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena. More than in past years.Congratulations to my children, Don and Tiffany, on having done a fantastic job last night.

President Obama just had a news conference, but he doesn't have a clue. Our country is a divided crime scene, and it will only get worse!Our country is totally divided and our enemies are watching. We are not looking good, we are not looking smart, we are not looking tough!I will be on @60Minutes tonight at 7:00 P.M. with Mike Pence talking about LAW AND ORDER and many other subjects! Bad times for divided USA!We are TRYING to fight ISIS, and now our own people are killing our police. Our country is divided and out of control. The world is watchingWe grieve for the officers killed in Baton Rouge today. How many law enforcement and people have to...
The ratings at @FoxNews blow away the ratings of @CNN - not even close. That's because CNN is the Clinton News Network and people don't like.@FoxNews is much better, and far more truthful, than @CNN, which is all negative. Guests are stacked for Crooked Hillary! I don't watch.If Goofy Elizabeth Warren, a very weak Senator, didn't lie about her heritage (being Native American) she would be nothing today. Pick her HI hope that Crooked Hillary picks Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, as her V.P. Then we can litigate her fraud!It doesn't matter that Crooked Hillary has experience, look at all of the bad decisions she has made. Bernie said she has bad judgement!As the days and weeks go by,  we see what a total mess our country (and world) is in - Crooked Hillary Clinton led Obama into bad decisions!We are going to have a great time in Cleveland. Will lead to special results for our country. We will Make America Great Again!Goofy Elizabeth Warren, who may be the least productive Senator in the U.S. Senate, must prove she is not a fraud.

What was she thinking?Is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct? Big mistake by an incompetent judge!On my way to San Diego to raise money for the Republican Party. I am spending a lot myself and also helping others.Voters understand that Crooked Hillary's negative ads are not true- just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity.Despite spending $500k a day on TV ads alone #CrookedHillary falls flat in nationwide @QuinnipiacPoll.

It was my great honor - they do an amazing job.Just finished a press conference in Trump Tower wherein I gave information on which VETERANS groups got the $5,600,000 that I raised/gave!I have raised/given a tremendous amount of money to our great VETERANS, and have got nothing but bad publicity for doing so. Watch!So many great things happening - new poll numbers looking good!

Nice!In getting the endorsement of the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents (thank you), the statement was made that the WALL was very necessary!Obama says a WALL at our southern border won't enhance our security (wrong) and yet he now wants to build a much bigger wall (fence) at W.H.If dummy Bill Kristol actually does get a spoiler to run as an Independent, say good bye to the Supreme Court!The Republican Party has to be smart & strong if it wants to win in November. Can't allow lightweights to set up a spoiler Indie candidate!Bill Kristol has been wrong for 2yrs-an embarrassed loser, but if the GOP can't control their own, then they are not a party.

Thousands of American lives lost. #MDWDon't believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign. The only quote that matters is a quote from me!I am always on the front page of the failing @nytimes, but when I won the GOP nomination, I'm in the back of the paper. Very dishonest!The media is on a new phony kick about my management style. I spend much less money & get much better results! What we need as Prez!The failing @nytimes wrote a story about my management style & that I don't have many people.

It will not be forgotten. #Trump2016.@kimguilfoyle- just watched you on @OutnumberedFNC- thank you!The Inspector General's report on Crooked Hillary Clinton is a disaster. Such bad judgement and temperament cannot be allowed in the W.H.Thank you Anaheim, California!
#Trump2016pic.twitter.com/AEShamhNVSThank you Washington! Honored to say, on behalf of our great movement, we have broken the all time record for votes in GOP primary history.The protesters in New Mexico were thugs who were flying the Mexican flag. The rally inside was big and beautiful, but outside, criminals!Crooked Hillary Clinton just can't close the deal with Bernie. I had to knock out 16 very good and smart candidates. Hillary doesn't have itGoofy Senator Elizabeth Warren @elizabethforma has done less in the U.S. Senate than practically any other senator. All talk, no action!Great rally in New Mexico, amazing crowd! Now in L.A. Big rally in Anaheim.Thank you Washington! #Trump2016
#MakeAmericaGreatAgainpic.twitter.com/v9glTwj6gyGreat honor to receive today's endorsement of @RickSantorum. Really nice! #Trump2016After raising, w/ no obligation, almost $6M for Vets, I couldn't believe protesters formed @ Trump Tower. JUST OUT- SENT BY CROOKED HILLARY!Thank you @DailyMail- for setting the failing @NYTimes story straight. This is what the NYT's should have written!http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3607052/The-sexist-boss-Trump-critic-Barbara-Res-REALLY-thought-turned-Donald-got-rid-refused-hire-back.html …A suggestion for the dishonest media- https://www.instagram.com/p/BFy12zpmhc9/ A wonderfully written article concerning Israel by @JasonDovEsqhttp://blogs.timesofisrael.com/a-trump-presidency-means-a-safer-israel/ …A great new book has been written about Crooked Hillary. Read it & you will never be able to vote for her. @Ed_Kleinhttp://www.amazon.com/Unlikeable-Problem-Hillary-Edward-Klein/dp/1621573788 …Crooked Hillary Clinton overregulates, overtaxes and doesn't care about jobs. Most importantly, she suffers from plain old bad judgement!I just released my financial disclosure forms, the largest numbers in the history of the F.E.C. Even the dishonest media thinks great!Amazingly, with all of the money I have raised for the vets, I have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media.Much of the money I have raised for our veterans has already been distributed, with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups.While under no obligation to do so, I have raised between 5 & 6 million dollars, including 1million dollars from me, for our VETERANS. Nice!Join me in California or Montana!

Would be four more years of stupidity!Crooked Hillary said that I  want guns brought into the school classroom. Wrong!Thank you to all of the men and women who have served our country. You are our true heroes! #ArmedForcesDaypic.twitter.com/A3Wus0cRIOCrooked Hillary Clintons foreign interventions unleashed ISIS in Syria, Iraq and Libya.

#MakeAmericaGreatAgainpic.twitter.com/hK1yqlp9caMichael Barbaro, the author of the now discredited @nytimes hit piece on me with women, has in past tweeted badly about me. He should resignI look so forward to debating Crooked Hillary Clinton! Democrat Primaries are rigged, e-mail investigation is rigged - so time to get it on!I can't believe that @CNN would allow the very nice Jeffrey Lord to be savaged by a panel of seven Trump haters. 7 to 1 - Don't watch CNN!Well, that is it.

Keep the big numbers going - VOTE TRUMP! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!Crooked Hillary Clinton put out an ad where I am misquoted on women. Can't believe she would misrepresent the facts! My hit was on ChinaThe pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line. You can tell them to go BLANK themselves - was about China, NOT WOMEN!Wow, 30,000 e-mails were deleted by Crooked Hillary Clinton. She said they had to do with a wedding reception. Liar! How can she run?What Barbara Res does not say is that she would call my company endlessly, and for years, trying to come back. I said no.I gave a woman named Barbara Res a top N.Y. construction job, when that was unheard of, and now she is nasty. So much for a nice thank you!In politics, and in life, ignorance is not a virtue. This is a primary reason that President Obama is the worst president in U.S. history!The writer of the now proven false story in the @nytimes, Michael Barbaro, who was interviewed on CBS this morning, was unable to respond.Over 50 women were interviewed by the @nytimes yet they only wrote about 6. That’s because there were so many positive statements.No wonder the @nytimes is failing—who can believe what they write after the false, malicious & libelous story they did on me.The failing @nytimes is greatly embarrassed by the totally dishonest story they did on my relationship with women.Rowanne Brewer, the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday joined @foxandfriends.https://amp.twimg.com/v/ebf3185d-9258-407b-a53a-a92289f9e7fb …Thank you, Anthony @Scaramucci @WSJ The Entrepreneur's Case for Trumphttp://www.wsj.com/articles/the-entrepreneurs-case-for-trump-1463344997?mod=trending_now_ …With the coming forward today of the woman central to the failing @nytimes hit piece on me, we have exposed the article as a fraud!A political commentator for @cnn, which I no longer watch, said Trump showed some weakness in the Repub Primaries. I set all-time record!Wow, Rowanne Brewer, the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday, was on @foxandfriends saying Times liedThe @nytimes is so dishonest.

The system is rigged against him. He should run as an independent! Run Bernie, run.Great new poll- thank you!

Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective. Does nothing. All talk, no action -- maybe her Native American name?Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant. She is too easy! I'm driving her nuts.Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders. Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me.Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska. Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant, but leaves behind amazing legacy.Goofy Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton’s flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American.Let’s properly check goofy Elizabeth Warren’s records to see if she is Native American. I say she’s a fraud!I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. I will defeat them both.Response to @LindseyGrahamSC:
I hear @JoeNBC of rapidly fading @Morning_Joe is pushing hard for a third party candidate to run. This will guarantee a Crooked Hillary win.Joe Scarborough initially endorsed Jeb Bush and Jeb crashed, then John Kasich and that didn't work. Not much power or insight!Thank you to teachers across America! When I become POTUS we will make education a far more important component of our life than it is now.Crooked Hillary has ZERO leadership ability. As Bernie Sanders says, she has bad judgement. Constantly playing the women's card - it is sad!Paul Ryan said that I inherited something very special, the Republican Party. Wrong, I didn't inherit it, I won it with millions of voters!So many great endorsements yesterday, except for Paul Ryan! We must put America first and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!Governor Rick Perry said Donald Trump is one of the most talented people running for the Presidency I've ever seen. Thank you Rick!Unlike crooked Hillary Clinton, who wants to destroy all miners, I want wages to go up in America. We will do so by bringing back jobs!Thank you West Virginia. Let's keep it going.

On the way to the great state of Rhode Island- big rally. Then to Pennsylvania for rest of day and night!Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - can't make a deal work.Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses.Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness!Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors & special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad!Wow, just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION!I am happy to hear how badly the @nytimes is doing. It is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down. Becoming irrelevant!I will be in Maryland this afternoon for a major rally. Things are looking good for Tuesday!.@AndreBauer  Great job and advice on @CNN @jaketapper  Thank you!.@Borisep was great on @JudgeJeanine tonight. Very smart commentary that will prove to be correct!As soon as John Kasich is hit with negative ads, he will drop like a rock in the polls against Crooked Hillary Clinton. I will win!I had a great day campaigning in Connecticut. Looking for a big vote on Tuesday!Congratulations to @seanhannity on his great ratings and ratings increase as reported by the @AP today.

They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify!Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out!I will be doing the @TODAYshow with my wife, Melania, and the rest of my family in a major Town Hall. Hopefully, it will be fun!

New CBS National Poll just out - massive lead for Trump. The Wall Street Journal/NBC Poll is a total joke. No wonder WSJ is doing so badly!I love being in South Carolina. We are leading big in all of the State polls - Saturday is a BIG day. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!The just out USA Today National Poll, where I lead by big numbers, shows that in a head to head matchup, I beat both Hillary and Bernie.Amazing that while I lead by big numbers in the new Q and and USA Today polls, the the press only wants to report on the phony WSJ/NBC poll.Join us tomorrow in Kiawah, South Carolina! #SCPrimary #VoteTrumpSC

He wants to look cool, but it's far too late. 1% in Nevada!Just out Nevada poll shows Jeb Bush at 1%, he should take his dumb mouthpiece, @LindseyGrahamSC, and just go home..@FoxNews is so biased it is disgusting. They do not want Trump to win. All negative!I will beat Hillary easily, but Lindsey Graham says I won't, and yet he got zero against me- no cred! Why does FOX put him on?.@lindseygraham, who had zero in his presidential run before dropping out in disgrace- saying the most horrible things about me on @FoxNews.Interesting how President Obama so haltingly said I would never be president - This from perhaps the worst president in U.S. history!Why does @megynkelly devote so much time on her shows to me, almost always negative?  Without me her ratings would tank. Get a life Megyn!Thank you  @kayleighmcenany for your nice words - great knowledge and style! We are doing really well in South Carolina. @CNN @donlemon.@brithume thinks that when Republicans drop out of the race, someone will pick up ALL of that vote. The fact is I will get much of it!Explain to @brithume and @megynkelly, who know nothing, that I will beat Hillary and win states (and dem-indie votes) that no other R can!Will be interviewed by @StephenAtHome tonight by phone- a late show first @CBS @colbertlateshow.

#Trump2016 #VoteTrumpSCJEB is a hypocrite! Used massive private Eminent Domain --- Just another clueless politician!http://theconservativetreehouse.com/2016/02/08/governor-jeb-bush-has-a-much-more-serious-eminent-domain-problem-than-donald-trump/ …Jeb used Eminent Domain & took advantage of a disabled vet in the process. (2/2)
I'd like to call JEB a liar, but the truth is he has no clue & never revealed that he used Eminent Domain- when criticizing me! (1/2)Now that George Bush is campaigning for Jeb(!), is he fair game for questions about World Trade Center, Iraq War and eco collapse? Careful!I will be in South Carolina all week. Saturday is BIG, BIG, BIG! Get out and vote - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAINJeb Bush and Ted Cruz are not electable presidential candidates, Hillary would destroy them. Ted may not be eligible to run - born in CanadaFunny that Jeb(!) didn't want help from his family in his failed campaign and didn't even want to use his last name.Then mommy, now brother!Ted Cruz, along with Jeb Bush, pushed Justice John Roberts onto the Supreme Court. Roberts could have killed ObamaCare twice, but didn't!Wow, in the new CBS Poll I went way up into the forties! Thank you!Tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists & special interests - the bosses!Loved the debate last night, and almost everyone said I won, but the RNC did a terrible job of ticket distrbution. All donors & special intsThank you for your support! TOGETHER we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
I will be on Face the Nation with John Dickerson on CBS this morning. Enjoy!This shows what a complete & total liar Ted Cruz is- he said he wouldn't have nominated John Roberts. Really?http://www.nationalreview.com/article/214989/right-stuff-ted-cruz …Even though every poll, Time, Drudge etc., has me winning the debate by a lot, @FoxNews only puts negative people on. Biased - a total joke!#GOPDebate #GoogleTrendspic.twitter.com/yVxFubckNsHey @glennbeck- see how I beat your boy Ted- in your own Blaze poll? Your endorsement means nothing! #GOPDebate#MakeAmericaGreatAgain!pic.twitter.com/Cwp6Ub5GqJAll polls have me winning debate big- Drudge, TIME, etc. Dopey Charles Krauthammer still nasty. He has zero cred- totally dishonest!How can @JebBush beat Hillary Clinton- if he can't beat anyone else on the #GOPDebate stage with $150M? I am the only one who can!Thank you! I miss my father.https://twitter.com/eustacefash/status/698735409501757440 …Lightweight @JebBush said tonight he didn't know his family used private eminent domain in Texas- Lie! 
#GOPDebateOn the way to the #GOPDebate with my wonderful wife @MelaniaTrump.
Ted Cruz is a cheater! He holds the Bible high and then lies and misrepresents the facts!Nasty Ted Cruz is at it again- same dirty tricks he used w/ @RealBenCarson- saying I may not be on ballot & I hold liberal positions. LIES!Wow! Honored to be chosen by the highly respected + accurate Washington & Lee Mock Convention. I hope you are right - I will make you proud!The totally unexpected loss of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is a massive setback for the Conservative movement and our COUNTRY!Love the people of South Carolina - look very much forward to the debate tonight.Thank you, South Carolina! We will MAKE AMERICA SAFE & GREAT AGAIN!

Message from @IvankaTrump: https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/videos/10156633253035725/ …How can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest?Lying Cruz put out a statement, “Trump & Rubio are w/Obama on gay marriage. Cruz is the worst liar, crazy or very dishonest. Perhaps all 3?Weak JEB getting thrown out by management during speech.

#MakeAmericaGreatAgainWe are getting reports from many voters that the Cruz people are back to doing very sleazy and dishonest pushpolls on me. We are watching!Jeb failed as Jeb! He gave up and enlisted Mommy and his brother (who got us into the quicksand of Iraq). Spent $120 million.Weak-no chance!He (or she) who hesitates is lost: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!Remember, it was the Republican Party, with the help of Conservatives, that made so many promises to their base, BUT DIDN'T KEEP THEM! Hi DT.@MarkHalperin showed a focus group on @Morning_Joe me using a very bad word. I never said the word, left an open blank. Please apologize!Jeb Bush spent more than $40,000,000 in New Hampshire to come in 4 or 5, I spent $3,000,000 to come in 1st. Big difference in capability!There are no buyers for the worthless @NYDailyNews but little Mort Zuckerman is frantically looking. It is bleeding red ink - a total loser!I have been consistent in my opposition to Common Core. Get rid of Common Core--- keep education local!THANK YOU- Clemson, South Carolina! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #SCPrimarypic.twitter.com/FgACmaFxxcI was referring to the fact that Jeb Bush wants to keep common core.Big speech tonight in South Carolina - 7:00 P.M. Tremendous crowd!So funny, Jeb Bush called me a highly gifted politician and a great entertainer - I assume that is a compliment!Such a great experience in New Hampshire - amazing people! Will be leaving for a big event in South Carolina today.Like the worthless @NYDailyNews, looks like @politico will be going out of business. Bad reporting- no money, no cred!Worthless @NYDailyNews, which dopey Mort Zuckerman, is desperately trying to sell, has no buyer! Liabilities are massive!Dopey Mort Zuckerman, owner of the worthless @NYDailyNews, has a major inferiority complex. Paper will close soon!Thank you to the people of  New Hampshire, I love you! Now, off to South Carolina.Thank you, New Hampshire! Departing with my amazing family now! #FITN #NHPrimary

Enjoy! @FoxNewsBased on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and choice - a total lie!The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. FraudMany people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz.Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!Great job on @donlemon tonight @kayleighmcenany @cherijacobus begged us for a job. We said no and she went hostile. A real dummy! @CNNOn my way to New Hampshire- expecting a big and spirited crowd!

Anybody who watched all of Ted Cruz's far too long, rambling, overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his Howard Dean moment!.@Morning_Joe @mikebarnicle on @realDonaldTrump: He finished 2nd but he made the turn successfully like a proI don't believe I have been given any credit by the voters for self-funding my campaign, the only one. I will keep doing, but not worth it!I will be talking about my wonderful experience in Iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the media-later in New Hampshire. Big crowdThe media has not covered my long-shot great finish in Iowa fairly. Brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history!Because I was told I could not do well in Iowa, I spent very little there - a fraction of Cruz & Rubio. Came in a strong second. Great honorMy experience in Iowa was a great one. I started out with all of the experts saying I couldn't do well there and ended up in 2nd place.

ENJOY!If I would have done the last debate, a record would have been set (instead of the poor ratings recieved). Also, VETS got $6,000,000.By not doing the failed, poorly rated debate, I was able to make the point of not allowing unfairness - while raising $6,000,000 for VETS.Wow, just saw an ad - Cruz is lying on so many levels. There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me, will repeal & replace. He lies!Ted Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form. Very low interest loans, scam!Ted Cruz is totally unelectable, if he even gets to run (born in Canada). Will loose big to Hillary. Polls show I beat Hillary easily! WIN!I will be going to church in Iowa this morning with my wife, Melania. After church I will be making two speeches and touring the State!.@bobvanderplaats is a total phony and con man. When I wouldn't give him free hotel rooms and much more, he endorsed Cruz. @foxandfriends.@bobvanderplaats asked me to do an event. The people holding the event called me to say he wanted $100,000 for himself.Phony @foxandfriends.@bobvanderplaats is a total phony and dishonest guy. Asked me for expensive hotel rooms, free (and more). I said pay and he endorsed Cruz!The Cruz campaign issued a dishonest and deceptive get out the vote ad calling voters in violation.

Not one Senator  is endorsing Canada Ted!.@BenSasse looks more like a gym rat than a U.S. Senator. How the hell did he ever get elected?  @gretaThe great State of Nebraska can do much better than @BenSasse as your Senator. Saw him on @greta - totally ineffective.

Is Cruz honest? He is in bed w/ Wall St. & is funded by Goldman Sachs/Citi, low interest loans. No legal disclosure & never sold off assets.Cruz did not renounce his Canadian citizenship as a US Senator- only when he started to run for #POTUS. He could be Canadian Prime Minister.Cruz says I supported TARP, which gave $25 million to Goldman Sachs, the bank which loaned him the money he didn't disclose. Puppet!The only reason irrelevant @GlennBeck doesn't like me is I refused to do his failing show - asked many times. Very few listeners - sad!.@BrentBozell, one of the National Review lightweights, came to my office begging for money like a dog. Why doesn't he say that?Just watched Jeb's ad where he desperately needed mommy to help him. Jeb --- mom can't help you with ISIS, the Chinese or with Putin.Ted Cruz went down big in just released Reuters poll - what's going on?

Ted Cruz purposely, and illegally, did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks.

Wow, no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate.The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember, his wife's employer, and his lender, is located there!Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand.

Thank you to a #Trump2016 supporter for this video of my campaign- over the past 6 months. Video: https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/posts/10156467989725725:0 …Strange, but I see wacko Bernie Sanders allies coming over to me because I'm lowering taxes, while he will double & triple them, a disaster!Wages in are country are too low, good jobs are too few,  and people have lost faith in our leaders.We need smart and strong leadership now!Many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone, shipped to other countries. We now are part time, sad! I WILL FIX!The middle-class has worked so hard, are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of - and no  effective raise in years. BADIf Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband, with his terrible record of women abuse, while playing the women's card on me, she's wrong!Hopefully the Republican National Committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in Virginia's Republican Party. FAST!Straighten out The Republican Party of Virginia before it is too late. Stupid!  RNC.@BernieSanders-who blew his campaign when he gave Hillary a pass on her e-mail crime, said that I feel wages in America are too high. Lie!Why are @JebBush flunkies  @ananavarro and @secupp, two of the dumbest people in politics, always on the @CNN panels..and yet Poll:Trump 39The voters the Republican Party of Virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory. The Dems LOVE IT! Be smart and win for a change!R.P.Virginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row. Will now not allow desperately needed new voters. Suicidal mistake. RNC MUST ACT NOW!It begins, Republican Party of Virginia, controlled by the RNC, is working hard to disallow independent, unaffiliated and new voters. BAD!I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:00. Will be talking about Hillary and far more interesting subjects. Enjoy!I will do far more for women than Hillary, and I will keep our country safe, something which she will not be able to do-no strength/stamina!Thank you! #Trump2016
Hillary Clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but HE'S DEMONSTRATED A PENCHANT FOR SEXISM, so inappropriate!A new terror warning was issued for European cties. At what point do we say we have had enough and get really tough and smart. Weak leaders!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016

We are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country. MUST CHANGE!The Phoenix V.A., it has just been reported, is in worse shape than ever before. The wait is horrendous, and people are dying. I will fix itThe same people that said I wouldn't run, or that I wouldn't lead or do well (1st place and leading by 21%), now say I won't beat Hillary..@chucktodd is so dishonest in his reporting...and to think he was going off the air until I came along-no ratings. I will beat Hillary!When will the Democrats, and Hillary in particular, say we must build a wall, a great wall, and Mexico is going to pay for it? Never!Our great VETERANS are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the V.A. That will stop, I will fix this quickly!Remember when failed candidate @JebBush said that illegals came across the border as AN ACT OF LOVE? He's spent $59 million and is at 3%.We have many problems in our house (country!), and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now, because of me, starting to deport people who are here illegally. Politics!.@deedeesorvino was GREAT today on @FoxNews  She gets what is going on in politics, and sees it very clearly. Have her on more!Merry Christmas to all. Have a great day and have a really amazing year. Together, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! It will be done!.@danielhalper  Great job on @CNN today. Very wise indeed!.@HallieJackson Why didn't you report Hillary lying about the ISIS video. Bad reporting. Perhaps @NBC will do better next year-but doubt it!I am now in Palm Beach, Florida, and will be going to church tonight. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!.@meetthepress and @chucktodd very dishonest in not showing the new @CNN Poll where I am at 39%, 21points higher than Cruz. Be honest Chuck!Why isn't @chucktodd using the much newer @CNN Poll when discussing how well I am doing instead of the older Q Poll? CNN even better!Wow, because of the pressure put on by me, ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS. It's about time!Next year will be an interesting one. I look forward to running against Hillary Clinton, a totally flawed candidate, and beating her soundlyThird rate reporters Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman of the failing @nytimes are totally in the Hillary circle of bias. Think about Bill!Wow, even lowly Rand Paul has just past @JebBush in the new @CNN Poll. Jeb is at 3%, I'm at 39%. Stop throwing your money down the drain!In the ridiculous @JebBush ad about me, Jeb is speaking to me during the debate, but doesn't allow my answer, which destroys him - SO SAD!Poor @JebBush spent $50 million on his campaign, I spent almost nothing. He's bottom (and gone), I'm top (by a lot). That's what U.S. needs!A great Christmas movie & perfect #TBT! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Hillary, when you complain about a penchant for sexism, who are you referring to. I have great respect for women. BE CAREFUL!It is hard to believe I am winning by so much when I am treated so badly by the media.  New @CNN Poll amazing in ALL categories. 21 pt. LeadWhy does @FoxNews give @KarlRove so much airtime. He (and other Fox pundits) is so biased. Still thinks Romney won. Unfair coverage of Trump.@FoxNews treats me so badly. Using old Quinnipiac Poll where I have a much smaller lead than the just out @CNN Poll. All negative!The @washingtonpost, which is the lobbyist (power) for not imposing taxes on #Amazon, today did a nasty cartoon attacking @tedcruz kids. BadThe silent majority- is silent no more! Remember the importance of VOTING!

Dishonest #MSMNPR's @NealConan said schlonged to WaPo re: 1984 Mondale/Ferraro campaign: That ticket went on to get schlonged at the polls. #HypocrisyOnce again, #MSM is dishonest. Schlonged is not vulgar. When I said Hillary got schlonged that meant beaten badly.Jeb's big ad buy against me, paid for by lobbyists, shows my face but doesn't have me answering Jeb's statements. He is really pathetic!Watching @CNN and consider @secupp to be one of the least talented people on television. Boring and biased!Women defy media narrative, love Trump at packed Michigan rally.

Being at 2% and falling seems to have totally affected his confidence. A basket case!We need a #POTUS with great strength & stamina. Hillary does not have that.

This was fact checked by @FoxNews: FALSE.@jonkarl was totally misled, and he fell for it, that Hillary wants to run against me. She knows that I am her worst nightmare-Jon doesn't!.@GStephanopoulos stupidly believes that Hillary wants to run against me because she said so. She says that so people believe it - opposite!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016pic.twitter.com/7FkgBAqF4AThank you America! @FoxNews post-debate poll with +/- from previous poll. #VoteTrump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgainpic.twitter.com/KorKlSr01PThank you Cedar Rapids, Iowa!

Weak & ineffective @JebBush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response. False advertising!I have an idea for @JebBush whose campaign is a disaster.

EXCLUSIVE: Newt Gingrich: ‘The Country Is in Rebellion,’ Trump Can ‘Kick Down the Doors’ 
Why doesn't @FoxNews quote the new Iowa @CNN Poll where I have a 33% to 20% lead over Ted Cruz and all others. Think about it!People have got to stop working to be so politically correct and focus all of their energy on finding solutions to very complex problems!I was disappointed that Ted Cruz would speak behind my back, get caught, and then deny it. Well, welcome to the wonderful world of politics!I did interview with Chris Wallace of @FoxNews in order to be fair. He then puts on Rove, Lane and Will, three Trump bashers, to discuss.Many think that the Championship Course at Turnberry, home of The Duel In The Sun, will be the worlds best after the renovation.A very good NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll was just released wherein I went up from last month and am in the lead. Nice!.@danawhite  Great job last night - very exciting! You have come a long way from those difficult early days, I am proud of you.People that have read it tell me that @KarlRove book is terrible (and boring).

An all talk, no action dummy!http://www.businessinsider.com/karl-roves-historically-colossal-waste-of-money-2012-11 ….@WSJ and dopey Karl Rove made a mistake and purposely mischaracterized my statement on the terrible TPP deal.https://theintercept.com/2015/11/11/trump-was-right-about-tpp-benefitting-china/ …Why does the failing @WSJ write a false editorial about me and let dummy @KarlRove make the same mistake in the same edition of the paper?.@KarlRove is a biased dope who wrote falsely about me re China and TPP. This moron wasted $430 million on political campaigns and lost 100%We, as a country, either have borders or we don't. IF WE DON'T HAVE BORDERS, WE DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY!Why wouldn't the @WSJ call for comment or clarification before writing an editorial which is so totally wrong. No wonder it is doing poorly!When and how are the dummies at the @WSJ going to apologize to me for their totally incorrect Editorial on me. I want smart trade deals.The @WSJ Editorial Board is so wrong, so often. They got info from an incorrect story in another pub. Why not watch and listen to debate..@WSJ Editorial Board should review my debate statement re China and T.P.P. and apologize. China not part but will get their way in later.Today's @WSJ Editorial is WRONG again. I know that China is not in the new T.P.P. trade deal but would come in latter through a back door.I will be interviewed on @MariaBartiromo @FoxBusiness at 7:30All seven on-line polls, including Drudge and Time, with thousands of respondents, said I won the debate. @krauthammer said I was so, so.Will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight at 8 PM.I will be on @marklevinshow at 8PM tonight.

Both solid & good guys. @FoxBusinessCarson now admits his friend named Bob, who he tried to stab (Bob was saved by his belt buckle!), no longer exists as Bob. Wrong name!With Ben Carson wanting to hit his mother on head with a hammer, stab a friend and Pyramids built for grain storage - don't people get it?Such bad reporting: A puff piece on Ben Carson in the @nytimes states that Carson is trying to solidify his lead. But I am #1, easily! SadFlorida Ethics Commission Advocate comes down hard on Rubio. So do two people who worked with him. Said he used the wrong credit card! Sure.A great honor to easily finish FIRST in the @FoxNews poll tabulation even though some of my best polls were not used in determining winner!The Carson story is either a total fabrication or, if true, even worse-trying to hit mother over the head with a hammer or stabbing friend!Rubio lied about my meeting w/ Hispanic activists. I didn’t change my opinion but treated them w/ respect. Shame! 
.@seanhannity should have corrected Jeb Bush when he said that I ran for president twice. Never ran, merely considered running!Jeb Bush just said about Marco Rubio, he's my friend! Pure political speak. Why can't he be truthful and say disloyal guy, no friend!Also, tune in to the @TodayShow at 7:00am.

I'll be signing copies of my book CRIPPLED AMERICA. Don't miss it!If Jeb Bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with Marco in the debate. BAD facts for Marco if properly delivered!Marco Rubio will not win. Weak on illegal immigration, strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a lightweight.I told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other. Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor!Jeb's new slogan - Jeb can fix it. I never thought of Jeb as a crook! Stupid message, the word fix is not a good one to use in politics!Anybody that believes in strong borders and stopping illegal immigration cannot vote for Marco Rubio  READ THIS: http://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2015/10/31/marco-rubios-new-billionaire-backer-top-funder-open-borders/ …Further proof that Gang of Eight member Marco Rubio is weak on illegal immigration is Paul Singer's, Mr. Amnesty, endorsement.Rubs can't winGov.

Bad info?This morning Chris Wallace has the best political show on television - but that's only because I'm on it (kidding)!
